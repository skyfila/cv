        I've been fascinated with art and replicating my favorite characters onto paper since I was young.
        Drawing was a way to focus my attention and ffed the urge to create things.
        I met an incredible teacher when I was in high school that taught me how to improve my art and skill by
        changing how I focus on my art.
        Opticianry is a field I happened to fall into and perform well in. After a vote in the house for deregulation,
        I grew more concerned for the future stability of being an optician. Once the pandemic hit, I grew to realize
        how much I enjoyed being with my family and knew I needed to change to a career that would allow me more
        flexibility.
        After a long search and dozens of courses, I found that programming gave me the same sense of satisfaction
        from creating that my art does. I've been through a terrible art block and have produced barely any pieces
        but after learning programming, I can draw better than I ever have before.
        Programming really feels like the answer that I've been searching for regarding who I want to become.
